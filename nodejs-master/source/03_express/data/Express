type
The type option is used to determine what media type the middleware will
parse.This option can be a string, array of strings, or a function. If not a 
function, type option is passed directly to the type-is library and this can be aneextension name(like bin), a mime type (like application/octet-stream), or a mime type with a wildcard (like */* or application/*). If a function the type
option is called as fn(req) and the request is parsed if it returns a truthy value.
Defaults to application/octet-stream.
